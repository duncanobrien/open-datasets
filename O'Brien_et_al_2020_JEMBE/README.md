# Introduction

Data from O’Brien, D.A., Taylor, M.L., Masonjones, H.D., Boersch-Supan, P.H., O’Shea, O.R., 2020. Drivers of octopus abundance and density in an anchialine lake: A 30 year comparison. Journal of Experimental Marine Biology. 528:151377. doi:10.1016/j.jembe.2020.151377.
This raw data provides the input for the generalised linear models predicting octopus counts across the Sweetings Pond ecosystem and yearly densities, as well as the qualitative assessment of benthic diversity.

## Funding
Data collection was funded and supported by the Center for Ocean Research and Education (https://www.coresciences.org).

## Structure
Replicate - abbreviation of site name and replicate number.

Site - the sampled sites within Sweetings Pond: 'Caves','Control','Grouper Cave', 'Octopus Den' (renamed as 'Emmas') and 'Quarry'.

Human_disturbance - whether the site is experiencing consistent human disturbance in the form of tourist traffic and/or agriculture.

Access - whether the site has a 'Public' or 'None' access to the water.

Latitude - latitude in WGS84 projection.

Longitiude - latitude in WGS84 projection.

Date - day/month/year.

Month - month

Average_depth - mean depth from surface in metres of the 30x30m quadrat.

Caves_distance - distance to 'Caves' public access point in metres.

Quarry_distance - distance to 'Quarry' public access point in metres.

Closest_entrance - distance to closest public access point in metres

Octopus_abundance - count of octopus occupying within the 30x30m quadrat replicate.
