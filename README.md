# Raw Data

## Introduction
This is a repository for published data generated by Duncan O'Brien and collaborators. Data here dates back to O'Brien et al. (2020) and consists of the data used to generate published results. The aim is to make the data transparent and accessible to collaborators and for future projects, with metadata specifying sites/species/variables etc.

## Structure
The repository will be split into different folders (publications) containing raw data and metadata.
