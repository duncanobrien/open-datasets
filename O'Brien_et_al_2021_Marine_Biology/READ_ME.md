# Introduction

Data from O’Brien, D.A., Taylor, M.L., Masonjones, H.D., Boersch-Supan, P.H., O’Shea, O.R., 2021. An experimental assessment of social tolerance and den ecology in a high-density octopus population. Marine Biology.
This raw data provides the input for the generalised linear models and generalised linear mixed effect models predicting octopus occupation of artificial dens.

## Funding
Data collection was funded and supported by the Center for Ocean Research and Education (https://www.coresciences.org).

## Structure
Replicate - abbreviation of site name and replicate number.

Site - the sampled sites within Sweetings Pond: 'Grouper Cave' and 'Emmas' (f.k.a 'Octopus Den').

Latitude - latitude in WGS84 projection.

Longitiude - latitude in WGS84 projection.

Date - day/month/year.

Depth - depth from surface in metres.

Soak_time - number of minutes den was underwater.

Den_number - number of dens within the den unit.

Caves_distance - distance to 'Caves' public access point in metres.

Quarry_distance - distance to 'Quarry' public access point in metres.

Octopus_abundance - number of octopus occupying the den unit (the response variable for den unit GLM).

Octopus_presence - number of octopus occupying the den (the response variable for den GLMM). 

prop_struc_colonised - proportion of the den unit occupied by octopus.

LC_cover - percentage cover of Laurencia. sp.

S_cover - percentage cover of sediment.

CR_cover - percentage cover of calcareous rubble.

F_cover - percentage cover of floccullant.

HY_cover - percentage cover of Hypnea. sp.

CS_cover - percentage cover of Caulerpa sertularioides.

MO_cover - percentage cover of Mytilopsis. sp.

PO_cover - percentage cover of Pinctada radiata.

Identifier - individual den identifier code to act as random effect.
